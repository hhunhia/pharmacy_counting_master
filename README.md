My implementation will convert all the text files in input folder to output folder. So, there is only "python ./src/pharmacy_counting.py" in run.sh. 

The test files in my input folder: "random1.txt" , "random2.txt" and "unit_test.txt". The "random1.txt" I add certain line to make it have the same cost in certain drug (basically, the most expensive and cheapest drugs have the same cost. ) . The results show that the drug names are in ascending order if the drug cost are the same.

# Instructions

Just use command line to run the shell file run.sh.
